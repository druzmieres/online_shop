##### Online Shop

OnlineShop is a simple Java project created to try Maven and Jenkins for the first time.

Aside from the Main class, it contains the classes Item and Comment. The class Item represents
an item on an online shop. Meanwhile, the class Comment represents a comment that a customer
made about an item.

A significant part of the content was taken from public sources and this project is by no means
a full implementation of an online shop.
